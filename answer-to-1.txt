i have something more for you to read, an another person's take on the matter: I skimmed through your code and thought I would give some comments from a software engineering standpoint (I'm a CS and Engineering student): Separate your code in modules! It's very difficult and annoying to read when everything is in the same gigantic python file. For instance, all your cards could go in a separate python module called Cards.py. Don't reinvent the wheel. There are several python libraries that handle databases very efficiently, and more importantly, incorporate the DB into the logical model of your application. For instance, SQLAlchemy, which lets you define tables as python classes with their own instance variables and methods. Separation of concerns. To me, it seems the Simulator and Player classes do TOO much. Simulator plays, and records and writes to the DB... For instance, I would encapsulate the database functionality into a separate module, and handle it on its own. Too much modularity. On the other hand, having a separate class for EVERY card is simply inefficient. I would have a general Card class which abstracts the general aspects of a class and use things like Composite patterns and a Factory patterns (look those up!) to generate new cards on the fly. Anyway, I really liked your project, and might give it a try a bit later today! EDIT: Also, extending from object (as in Simulator(object)) is not necessary since every python object automatically extends from object. You can just write: class Simulator: ...
